This app visualizes Indian district-level data on a dynamic map, allowing users to explore key statistics across different states using an intuitive UI. Powered by Plotly’s stunning mapbox visuals and Streamlit’s simplicity, this project is my first step into data-driven storytelling and web-based analytics.
